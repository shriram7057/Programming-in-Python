# Comparison Operator Demonstration in Python

# Define variables
a = 10  # First value
b = 20  # Second value

# Perform comparison operations and display results
print("a < b  :", a < b)   # Less than (True)
print("a > b  :", a > b)   # Greater than (False)
print("a <= b :", a <= b)  # Less than or equal to (True)
print("a >= b :", a >= b)  # Greater than or equal to (False)
print("a == b :", a == b)  # Equal to (False)
print("a != b :", a != b)  # Not equal to (True)
