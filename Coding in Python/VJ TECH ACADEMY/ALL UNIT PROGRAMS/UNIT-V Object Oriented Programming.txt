UNIT-V  Object Oriented Programming in Python
=============================================
Syntax: Class Declaration
-------------------------
	class ClassName:
		#list of class variables
		#list of class constructor
		#Class Method Definition

Example:
--------
	class Student:
		def getdata(self):
		     self.rollno=1010;
			 self.name="Dennis";
			 self.marks=98.99;
		def display(self):
			print("Student Roll No:",self.rollno);
			print("Student Name:",self.name);
			print("Student Marks:",self.marks);

Syntax: Object Creation
-----------------------
	ObjectName=className();
Example:
--------
	s1=Student();

Syntax: How to access member of the class:
-------------------------------------------
	ObjectName.MemberOfClass
	
Example:
--------
	s1.getdata();
	s1.display();
	
constructor:
============
- Constructor is a special method of the class.
- In python __init__() method is called constructor.
- Syntax:
	def __init__(self):
		#body of constructor

Class Attributes:
===================
__dict__ : display dictionary in which class namespaces is stored.
__name__ : it display name of the class.
__bases__ : it display tuple which contains name of the base classes.
__doc__ : it display documentation string.
__module__ : name of the module in which class is defined.

============================
Inheritance
============================
- The process of creating new class by using the concept of old class is known as Inheritance.
- Syntax:
	class A:
		#properties of class A
	class B(A):
		#properties of class B 
		#Inherited properties of class A 

Single Inheritance:
-----------------------
- To create new class from only one base class is known as Single Inheritance.

Method Overriding
==================

Composition Classes:
====================
- In Composition, we do not inherit from the base class but establish relationships between classes through the use of instance variables.
- Composition also reflects the relationships between the parts, called as "has-a" relationships.
- Composition enables creating complex types by combining objects of other types.
- This means, class composite can contain an object of another class component.
- The composite side can express cardinality of the relationship.
- The cardinality indicates the number or valid range of component instances.
- Cardinality can expressed in the following ways:
1) A number indicate the number of component instances that are contained in the composite. The * symbol indicates that the composite class can contain variable number of component instances.
2) A range 1..4 indicates that the composite class can contain range of component instances. The range is indicated with the minimum and maximum number of instances.

Syntax:
---------
	Class GenericClass:
		#define some attributes and methods
	Class ASpecificClass:
	    Instance_Variable_of_Generic_Class=GenericClass;
		#use this instance somewhere in the class
		some_method(Instance_Variable_of_Generic_Class);
Example:
---------
#for composition
class Gmail:
    def send_email(self,msg):
        print("Sending {} from gmail".format(msg));
class Yahoo:
    def send_email(self,msg):
        print("Sending {} from Yahoo".format(msg));

class Email:
    provider=Gmail();
    def set_provider(self,p):
        self.provider=p;
    def send_email(self,msg):
        self.provider.send_email(msg);

client1=Email();
client1.send_email("Hello");
client1.set_provider(Yahoo());
client1.send_email("Hello");
