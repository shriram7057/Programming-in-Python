#set is an unordered collection of unique items
# Set is defined by values separated by comma inside curly bracket { }.
# Items in a set are not ordered
# We can perform set operations like union, intersection on two sets. 
# Set have unique values. They eliminate duplicates
# Set are unordered collection of items and index numbers are not associated with it. Hence the 
# slicing operator [:] does not work 

a={10,20,30,40,50}
print("All elements in the set=",a)   # output is unorder sequence because set is  unordered collection of unique ietms
